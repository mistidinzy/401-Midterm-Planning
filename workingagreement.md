## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

  > If/when conflicts arise, we will be direct and mindful in communicating with each other. If we are not able to figure it out amongst ourselves, we will involve help from Keith, Craig and/or Stacey.

_____

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

  > Main hours: 9a - 5p; with flexible outside hours as needed.
  >
  > Use Slack as needed.
  >
  > Be in classroom as needed through lunches if available.
  >
  > Prioritize main functionality of site before stretch goals & design.

_____

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

> Utilize Trello to break down tasks into small, manageable chunks.
>
> Take ownership of task/feature you feel confident working on, but be mindful of time-boxing and speaking up when struggling for too long.
>
> Try Pair-Programming when stuck on a feature.

_____

  > Add as collaborators.
* What is your Git flow?
  > Work on branches.
* Will you be using a PR review workflow?
  > Yes.
* How many people must review a PR?
  > One.
* Who merges PRs?
  > Will determine/communicate as we ask for PR.
* How often will you merge?
  > As needed, before lunch & end of day.
  >
  > When we successfully complete a feature/task.
